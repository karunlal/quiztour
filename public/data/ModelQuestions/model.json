Instead, the universe was a hot, dense plasma of subatomic particles.\nStars and planets formed millions of years later, as matter cooled and condensed due to gravity.\nThe expansion created by the \"Big Bang\" continues even to the present day. ✅ Correct\n\nObservations show that galaxies are still moving apart, meaning the universe is continuing to expand.\nAfter temperatures dropped, the universe became transparent. ✅ Correct\n\nWhen the universe cooled enough (about 380,000 years after the Big Bang), atoms formed, and photons could travel freely, making the universe transparent.
